# Sunrise Alarm (Expo)

## Run
```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

## What it does
- Requests location (foreground).
- Fetches tomorrow's sunrise time for your location.
- Schedules a local notification at sunrise when enabled.

> Note: Local notifications are not the same as a full system alarm. They respect device settings like Focus/Silent mode.
