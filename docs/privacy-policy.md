**Effective date:** 2026-01-09

Sunriser – Alarm is a free app that helps you view sunrise/sunset times and optionally receive a sunrise notification.

## Information We Collect
Sunriser – Alarm does not require an account and does not collect your name, email address, phone number, or contact information.

### Location (Optional)
If you allow location access, the app uses your device’s location to calculate sunrise/sunset times and display local weather information. Location is used only for app functionality.

## How We Use Information
- To calculate and display sunrise and sunset times for your area
- To display weather information for your area (if you use the Weather screen)

## Notifications
If you enable the sunrise alarm, the app schedules a local notification on your device. Notifications are optional and can be turned off at any time in the app or in iOS Settings.

## Data Sharing
We do not sell your personal data.

To fetch sunrise and weather data, the app may send your approximate coordinates to a third-party data provider over an encrypted connection (HTTPS). We do not store your location on our own servers.

## Data Retention
The app may store your preferences on your device (for example: alarm toggle state and selected location). These settings remain on your device unless you delete the app.
